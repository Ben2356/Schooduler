Database tech: mySQL
user data to push to the server will be only the course tiles
settings are saved to local machine only

**long run: will have to have an account creation system so data stored is related to a specific user

Course Tile Data:
CourseName (string)
TimeStart (Time)
TimeEnd (Time)
TileColor (Color)
TaskList (List<Task>)
CourseDay (List<string>)
relatedButtons (List<ToggleButton>)  => going to need to find alternate method of having related buttons

relatedButtons ideas: 
array will still exist but be stored locally and not within the course Tile Data, creation will still be
the same however when the CourseTile data is read from the database, new relatedButtons array will have 
to be built based off the size of the CourseDay array during the assembly of the CourseList array

Task object contains:
bool completed
string assignment
DateTime due
string notes


DB Schema:
* is the primary key

Courses Table: 
course_id (int unsigned)*	#unique course ID
course_name (varchar(16))	#course names are limited to only 16 chars
time_start (varchar(16))	#serialize Time object into a string
time_end (varchar(16))		#^^
tile_color (varchar(16))	#serialize Color object into a string using ColorConverter

Days Table:
day_id* (int unsigned)		#unique day ID
course_id (int unsigned)	#all days in this table are mapped to a respective course_id
day (varchar(16))		#name of the day

Tasks Table:
task_id (int unsigned)*		#unique task ID
course_id (int unsigned)	#all tasks in this table are mapped to a respective course_id 
completed (tinyint unsigned)	#0 = false, 1 = true
assignment_name (varchar(32))	#
due (datetime)			#
notes (varchar(128))		#

Users Table:
user_id (int unsigned)		#unique user ID
username (varchar(16))		#user name
